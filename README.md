# Project: Fraud Detection using Neural Network and AWS Services
This repository contains the code and resources for a fraud detection system using a trained neural network model and various AWS services. The system involves a data pipeline that ingests data from a simulated website, processes it, and stores it in an Amazon RDS database. The neural network model, stored in an S3 bucket, is then applied to the data to detect potential fraudulent activities.

Overview
The fraud detection system comprises the following steps:

Neural Network Training: A neural network model is trained to detect fraudulent activities. The trained model is then stored in an S3 bucket for future use.
Data Collection: An AWS Lambda function is used to simulate and collect data from a website. This data is stored in another S3 bucket.
Data Processing: AWS Glue is used to process the collected data and transfer it to an Amazon RDS database.
Fraud Detection: Another Lambda function retrieves the processed data from the RDS database and the neural network model from the S3 bucket. The model is then applied to the data to identify potential fraud cases.
Results: The system outputs the fraud detection results, which can be used for reporting and email the customers who are facing the fraud risk.
Prerequisites
To run this project, we need:

An AWS account with access to services like Lambda, S3, Glue, and RDS.
Python 3.x installed on our local machine.
Basic knowledge of AWS services and neural network models.
Usage
Follow these steps to set up the fraud detection system:

Clone the repository: Clone this GitHub repository to our local machine.
Set up AWS Services: Configure the necessary AWS services, including Lambda, S3, Glue, and RDS, according to your requirements. Make sure to set appropriate access permissions and roles for each service.
Train the Neural Network: Train the neural network model using TensorFlow. After training, store the model in an S3 bucket.
Data Collection Lambda Function: Create Lambda function to simulate and collect data from the website. Store the collected data in an S3 bucket.
Set up AWS Glue: Configure AWS Glue to process the collected data from the S3 bucket and transfer it to the Amazon RDS database. Create a Glue job, crawler, and database connection as needed.
Fraud Detection Lambda Function: Create another Lambda function to retrieve the processed data from the RDS database and the neural network model from the S3 bucket. Use this Lambda function to apply the model to the data and detect potential fraud cases.
Monitor and Analyze Results: Monitor the output of the fraud detection system, and analyze the results for further action or reporting.
